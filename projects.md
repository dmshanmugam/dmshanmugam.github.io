A list of non-academic projects I have pursued: 

- [End of Signature](https://listart.mit.edu/art-artists/end-signature-2021-2022): AI-generated art sculptures in Kendall Square.
- [WhatGisMyBC](whatgismybc.pythonanywhere.com): A birth control pill's *generation* -- which roughly translates to what type of progesterone it uses -- has a large impact on the side effects pill users will experience. I built this website (and scraped a [dataset](https://github.com/divyashan/pill_info)) to help people map commerical birth control names to common side effects.
- [Making Mentorship Better](https://makingmentorshipbetter.github.io): I and other students in MIT EECS developed a guide to mentoring undergraduate researchers in the department. 
- [PersonalizedMinis](https://github.com/divyashan/personalized_mini): Code to generate personalized mini crosswards (a great gift!)
- [A Message Story](https://github.com/divyashan/a_message_story): Code to visualize your Facebook message history with someone (also a good gift!)

<!-- I really like word games. I wrote code to [generate personalized mini's](https://github.com/divyashan/personalized_mini) (a great gift!!), a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nytimed/hloelniielchalacnlmgdkjfkjfnccjg?hl=en) to track your NYTimes crossword stats, a [solver](https://github.com/divyashan/wordbrain_solver) for the game WordBrain, and [code](https://github.com/divyashan/a_message_story) to visualize your Facebook message history with someone. All this is to say I like word-game adjacent projects! Below is a set of minis I've made. I really like making them for people, so reach out if you'd like a something themed ☀️
