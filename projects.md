<!-- I really like word games. I wrote code to [generate personalized mini's](https://github.com/divyashan/personalized_mini) (a great gift!!), a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nytimed/hloelniielchalacnlmgdkjfkjfnccjg?hl=en) to track your NYTimes crossword stats, a [solver](https://github.com/divyashan/wordbrain_solver) for the game WordBrain, and [code](https://github.com/divyashan/a_message_story) to visualize your Facebook message history with someone. All this is to say I like word-game adjacent projects! Below is a set of minis I've made. I really like making them for people, so reach out if you'd like a something themed ☀️
