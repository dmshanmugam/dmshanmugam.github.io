I am a machine learning researcher interested in the intersection of machine learning, healthcare, and equity. I recently received my PhD from MIT, where I was fortunate to be advised by John Guttag as a member of the [Clinical and Applied Machine Learning Group](https://mit-caml.github.io). I work on developing techniques to **understand and update models in the presence of unreliable data**. This work has taken many forms and includes:
1. A method to measure health disparities for underreported outcomes.
2. A study on the impact of coarse race reporting on estimates of algorithmic fairness.
3. A method to improve the efficiency of conformal predictors using test-time augmentation.


<!-- Measuring rates of underreporting I work on techniques to 1)  model societal biases in large health datasets and 2) improve existing models by learning to transform the *data* instead of the model. My recent work has considered how we can measure health disparities (even when an outcome is underreported!) and the impact of coarse race reporting on estimates of algorithmic fairness. -->

Before this, I was at MIT for undergrad, where I majored in computer science with a concentration in South Asian studies. I have also spent time working with lovely collaborators at Microsoft Research (x2), Borealis AI, D.E. Shaw Research, Counsyl, and Aetion.
