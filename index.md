**Iâ€™m on the academic job market!** \\
**Please reach out if you know of an opportunity that would fit my background.**


I am a final-year Ph.D. student at MIT in the [Clinical and Applied Machine Learning Group](https://mit-caml.github.io), where I am fortunate to be advised by John Guttag.

My research is at the intersection of machine learning, healthcare, and algorithmic fairness, with a focus on developing techniques to **understand and update models in the presence of unreliable data**. I work on techniques to 1)  model societal biases in large health datasets and 2) improve existing models by learning to transform the *data* instead of the model. My recent work has considered how we can measure health disparities (even when an outcome is underreported!) and the impact of coarse race reporting on estimates of algorithmic fairness.

<!-- Before this, I was at MIT for undergrad, where I majored in computer science with a concentration in South Asian studies. I have also spent time working with lovely collaborators at Microsoft Research (x2), Borealis AI, D.E. Shaw Research, Counsyl, and Aetion.  -->
