I love a good side project:

- [End of Signature](https://listart.mit.edu/art-artists/end-signature-2021-2022): I helped create a pair of AI-generated sculptures in Kendall Square.
<!-- - [WhatGisMyBC](https://whatgismybc.pythonanywhere.com): A website to map commercial birth control pill names to common side effects. -->
- [Making Mentorship Better](https://makingmentorshipbetter.github.io): I wrote a guide to mentoring undergraduates in computer science.
- [PersonalizedMinis](https://github.com/divyashan/personalized_mini): I created a tool to generate personalized mini crosswords.
<!-- - [A Message Story](https://github.com/divyashan/a_message_story): A tool to visualize your Messenger history with someone (also a good gift!) -->
